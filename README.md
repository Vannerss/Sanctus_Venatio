Hack and Slash Game Project

My first time attempting to make a hack and slash combo system in 3D, runs terrible, super buggy, funny scenarios.

I used overcomplicated logic for the state machine cause I thought I was cool. State machine based on a Scriptable Object FSM,
made by an open unity project.
